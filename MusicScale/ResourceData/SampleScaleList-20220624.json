This sequence of pitches roughly describes the scale underlying the fifth of the eight Gregorian (church) modes, known as Mode V or the authentic mode on F, theoretically using B‚ôÆ but in practice more commonly featuring B‚ô≠.[1] The use of the B‚ô≠ as opposed to B‚ôÆ would have made such piece in the modern day F major scale.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydian_mode",

Almost all western musical instruments, such as the piano, are made to produce the chromatic scale, while other instruments capable of continuously variable pitch, such as the trombone and violin, can also produce microtones, or notes between those available on a piano.\n\nMost music uses subsets of the chromatic scale such as diatonic scales. While the chromatic scale is fundamental in western music theory, it is seldom directly used in its entirety in musical compositions or improvisation.",

One construction takes five consecutive pitches from the circle of fifths; starting on C, these are C, G, D, A, and E.

This means that it comprises the three irreducibly essential tones that define a dominant seventh chord, which are root, major third, and minor seventh and that all other chord tones have been altered. These are:\n\n- the fifth is altered to a ‚ô≠5 and a ‚ôØ5\n- the ninth is altered to a ‚ô≠9 and a ‚ôØ9\n- the eleventh is altered to a ‚ôØ11 (equivalent to a ‚ôØ4)\n- the thirteenth is altered to a ‚ô≠13 (equivalent to a ‚ôØ5)\n\nThe altered forms of some of the non-essential tones coincide (augmented eleventh with diminished fifth and augmented fifth with minor thirteenth) meaning those scale degrees are enharmonically identical and have multiple potential spellings. The natural forms of the non-essential tones are not present in the scale. This means it lacks a major ninth, a perfect eleventh, a perfect fifth, and a major thirteenth.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_scale",

In George Russell's Lydian Chromatic Concept it is the fifth mode (V) of the Lydian Diminished scale. It corresponds to the Raga Sarasangi in Indian Carnatic music.\n\nIt can be considered a major scale with the sixth degree lowered, Ionian ‚ô≠13, or the harmonic minor scale with the third degree raised. It may also be generated by reversing and rotating the succession of intervals in the harmonic minor scale. It contains the following chords, which are also considered borrowed from the parallel minor: the dominant minor ninth chord, the fully diminished seventh leading tone chord, the supertonic diminished triad, the supertonic half-diminished seventh chord, and the minor subdominant. It also contains an augmented triad.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_major_scale",

For example, the Iwato scale bears the same intervals as Slonimsky's concept of the Hirajoshi scale, and is also the fourth mode of the In scale.

Also called the altered Phrygian scale, dominant flat 2 flat 6 (in jazz), the Freygish scale (also spelled Fraigish), harmonic dominant, or simply the fifth mode of the harmonic minor scale. It resembles the scale of the Phrygian mode but has a major third. In the Berklee method, it is known as the Mixolydian ‚ô≠9 ‚ô≠13 chord scale, a Mixolydian scale with a lowered 9th (2nd) and lowered 13th (6th), used in secondary dominant chord scales for V7/III and V7/VI. Bebop jazz pianist Barry Harris added a note to the scale and describes his use as \"on C7, play down from the 7th of Eb7 to E the 3rd of C7‚Äù and especially over G-7b5 to C7b9 (the ii V in minor). He nicknamed this eight tone scale ‚Äúthe minor‚Äôs five‚Äù. Being eight tones it has the advantage of placing the chord tones on the beats which enables a melody to reinforce the underlying harmony. It also eliminates the harsh augmented 2nd melodic interval found in the seven tone 5th mode of harmonic minor scale. Another advantage is that gives improvisers an access to their often more familiar dominant scale vocabulary. Barry Harris further recognized that its descending form has an especially melodic quality rather than being played up from a root. He said he noticed this particular descending permutation being played by Charlie Parker several times on ‚ÄúWhat Is This Thing Called Love?‚Äù.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrygian_dominant_scale",

Scriabin, however, did not use the chord directly but rather derived material from its transpositions.\n\nWhen rooted in C, the mystic chord consists of the pitch classes: C, F‚ôØ, B‚ô≠, E, A, D.\n\nThis is often interpreted as a quartal hexachord consisting of an augmented fourth, diminished fourth, augmented fourth, and two perfect fourths. However, the chord may be spelled in a variety of ways, and it is related to other pitch collections, such as being a hexatonic subset of the overtone scale, lacking the perfect fifth.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystic_chord",

    "comment": "The scale of harmonics is a musical scale based on the noded positions of the natural harmonics existing on a string. This musical scale is present on the guqin, regarded as one of the first string instruments with a musical scale. Most fret positions appearing on Non-Western string instruments (lutes) are equal to positions of this scale. Unexpectedly, these fret positions are actually the corresponding undertones of the overtones from the harmonic series. The distance from the nut to the fret is an integer number lower than the distance from the fret to the bridge (see: superparticular number).\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_of_harmonics",

The scale originated in Nicolas Slonimsky's book Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns through the \"equal division of one octave into two parts,\" creating a tritone, and the \"interpolation of two notes,\" adding two consequent semitones after the two resulting notes.

It is related to both the Freygish and Misheberak scales and is used in Jewish music, \"predominant in klezmer bulgarish and doina (doyne).\" \"When the Ukrainian Dorian scale functions in the synagogue, it is a mode known as the Mi sheberach (May He Who Blessed) or Av horachamon (Compassionate Father).

Barry Harris explains that it is derived from a minor sixth chord from the root, and a fully diminished chord from the second degree.\n\nIt has all the notes of both the ascending form of the melodic minor scale and the harmonic minor scale of the same root. This scale is often used over minor sixth chords.\n\nThese scales are listed in David N. Baker's books on bebop. They are also included, with the exception of the Dorian bebop scale, in Roni Ben-Hur's book Talk Jazz: A Comprehensive Collection of Bebop Studies, which is derived from the work of Barry Harris. Ben-Hur further elaborates on the concept of placing additional chromatic passing tones between other notes in the scales.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bebop_scale",

These scales have been used by rock and jazz guitarists in search of 'new' sounds.\"\n\nBurrows gives C-E-F‚ôØ-G-B. Sachs, as well as Slonimsky, give C-D‚ô≠-F-G‚ô≠-B‚ô≠. Speed and Kostka & Payne give C-D-E‚ô≠-G-A‚ô≠. Note that all are hemitonic pentatonic scales (five note scales with one or more semitones) and are different modes of the same pattern of intervals, 2-1-4-1-4 semitones. Peter Sculthorpe's Earth Cry uses the Hirajoshi mode as a tonal centre of the work.\n\nThe five modes of hirajoshi can also be derived as subsets of the Ionian, Phrygian, Lydian, Aeolian, and Locrian modes.\n\nSynonymous scales have different names per region of Japan, as well as according to several ethnomusicologists and researchers, which may lead to some confusion. For example, the Iwato scale bears the same intervals as Slonimsky's concept of the Hirajoshi scale, and is also the fourth mode of the In scale. The same scale given by Kostka & Payne matches the third mode of the In scale.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiraj%C5%8Dshi_scale",

If you are looking forward to improvise Japanese music, then the Ryukyu scale can be an excellent choice.\n\nThe Ryukyu scale can be used to create a cheerful of uplifiting mood as it is belongs to the groups of Major scales. It is also very useful for jazz improvisation as well as blues, and is widely used in Western music.",
